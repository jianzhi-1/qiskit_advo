I thought the time complexity was $O(log(N))$ instead, because it takes an expected $log(N)$ steps to reach the minimum index. My mistake was that I didn't take into account the time complexity for amplitude amplification, which was $O(\\sqrt{N})$. Hence, combined time complexity is $O(\\sqrt{N}log(N))$.\n",

Then, by randomly picking one index and querying the oracle again, I would take an expected $O(log(N))$ steps to reach the minimum. So how does this quantum algorithm offer me superiority in complexity with the $\\sqrt{N}$ factor? I still haven't quite figured this out, but my thinking is that classically, such oracle would take at least $O(N)$ time complexity to query, while for quantum there exists a faster way if the database had already been converted to quantum.\n",
